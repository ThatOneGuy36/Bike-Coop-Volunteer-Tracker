This program is designed to help keep track of volunteers, their current number of hours volunteered, and all rewards they are entitled to. It is a simple way to keep records of all people at the coop,
and allows the staff to update this data in a simple, efficient way. 

This program mainly uses the Flask API for serving the web pages, and simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript to display the data collected so far. It is run on a local server, and all of the data is saved into a database
file which is stored in the same folder on the desktop.
